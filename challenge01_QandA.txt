Challenge 01 Question and Answers

mkdir temp
cd temp/
gem install unixoid-challenge
unixoid-challenge

01) Using one command, create a directory structure "my/private/files"
mkdir -p my/private/files

02) Using one command, create a directory structure "my/public/files"
mkdir -p my/public/files

03) Create an empty file 't-vars.env' in my/private/files
touch ./my/private/files/t-vars.env

04) Using command-line only add the line "List of env vars that begin with T" to the file, make sure it ends with a newline
cat > ./my/private/files/t-vars.env

05) List all env variables that begin with "T" (hint: you'll need a regex that includes the marker of the start of the line) and append them to the end of the file
env | grep ^T >> ./my/private/files/t-vars.env

06) Export a new variable TESTING_MAKERS=working in such a way that it is still available when you open a new shell
echo "export TESTING_MAKERS=working" >> ~/.bash_profile

07) Open a new terminal window, check that a new variable is available
echo $TESTING_MAKERS

08) Output the count of the variables that begin with T to a new file my/public/files/t-vars.count, e.g. "Overall count: 5" (hint: you'll need to use 'command substitution' in bash)
env | grep ^T | wc -l > ./my/public/files/t-vars.count

09) Change the permissions of the my/private/files/t-vars.env to make sure that only the owner can read and write the file
chmod go-rw ./my/public/files/t-vars.count

10) Change the permissions of the my/private/files directory to make sure that only the owner can change into it
chmod go-x my/private/files

11) Give read and write permissions to all users on my/public/files/t-vars.count
chmod ugo+rw ./my/public/files/t-vars.count

12) Create another file my/public/files/text-files-count.txt and output the number of text files in your home directory (recursively) into that file
find ~ -name "*.txt" | wc -l > my/public/files/text-files-count.txt

13) Create another file my/private/files/first-three-env.txt and output the first three env variables from a list of all of them sorted alphabetically
env | sort | head -3 > my/private/files/first-three-env.txt

14) Create another file my/private/files/commands.txt and output the contents of the history command to that file
history > my/private/files/commands.txt

end
